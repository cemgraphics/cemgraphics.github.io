        For my final project I wanted to use a MIDI controller to control uniform values in a simulation. I decided to use
        build on top of my reaction diffusion project. I wanted to control the flow and colors of the different fluids
        in the reaction. I decided that using the control knobs on the MIDI controller would allow me to adjust values
        to find sweet spots where the reaction looked pretty.

        I had a pulsing effect applied to my reaction diffusion to keep the simulation going without an end. I realized that changing
        the dA and dB values ever so slightly would result in the simulation dying. So I attached a random number generator to every
        MIDI key so that hitting a key would change the diffusion coefficients of the fluids in the system.
    </p>

    <p>
        I found out that changing the frequency variable created really cool effects in the simulation mainly because of the pulsing
        I had the pulsing effect by creating a new k value pulsing using a sin function and adjusting the frequency variable adjust
        the pulsing frequency, and a displacement variable to move the pulsing effect outward faster.
    </p>

        For feedback they told me they really liked being able to easily control the color, and ability to change the simulation in real time.
        They told me that the control knobs were a good interface between human input, and visual stimulation. They found a few bugs that would
        kill the simulation, or one bug where the entire shader would go black because I was dividing a value by 0. Overall they spent a good
        15 minutes playing with the simulation which was a nice experience to watch.
