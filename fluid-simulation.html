    In this project I wanted to create a fluid simulation that allows
    users to interact with a fluid by clicking and dragging on tha canvas.
    The simulation is composed of ten fragment shaders communicating to each
    other through 2D textures.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The first shader is a Boundary shader that decides how large the textures are
    going to be depending on the size of the canvas, which can be changed dynamically
    so a vec2 uniform stores the size of the canvas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The second shader is the AddMaterial shader that gets the mouse location, the length
    of how much it was dragged, and a radius to give it a swirl to replicate fluidity.
    there are 4 different materials (different colors) and they have a gradual shift
    between one material to the other.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The next shader is the Advect shaders which decides how to mix colors together
    depending on the velocity created by the clicking and dragging. Using a bilinear
    interpolation function that looks at the pixels around it and pushes materials
    to fuse them into each other, or pushes the color away by adding a new color to the mix.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The shaders that handle a lot of the physics are the Force shader that takes in mouse
    input and creates a velocity vector and add it to a texture to pass it to other shadres.
    The Divergence shader which decides how the force diverges through the texture using a finite
    difference formula. The Jacobi shader that solves diagonal pressure caused by the velocity
    texture. And finally the MoveParticle shader that decides which material should move in which direction.
    </p>
    <br>
    Finally all the shaders create a material texture and pass it to the Render shader that sets the
    initial states, supplies all the materials, and renders the moved materials depending on the texture
    location.
    <p>
        <br>
    The features I have changed from the initial simulation are the force shader, so every
    slight movement adds a push to what is in front of the cursor instead of creating one
    forward wave. I changed all of the colors, the background and the material colors and
    added a new material. I made it so that holding down the mouse button creates a spiral.
    I increased the wave radius to make larger shapes. I have also increased the speed at
    which the materials dissipate so it is more apparent.
    I have also spent many hours making the entire simulation work using glslify and pure webgl
    because the simulation uses a library for creating shaders, uniforms, and textures using webgl
    and I was able to debug everything, but could not figure out one texture issue using uniforms.
    so I ended up using the graphics library.

    For feedback I got compliments for my color palette of purple, indigo, and green. He really
    liked doing forward and backward movements to see the circular shapes. He also liked moving
    the mouse in circular motion while holding it down to create a chaotic mixture of colors.
    He also commented that he liked that the colors dissipate visibly, but he did not like the
    background color I picked. He really enjoyed creating a chaotic arrangement of colors.
