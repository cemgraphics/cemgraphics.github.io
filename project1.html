        I started the animation with a vec3 color variable, and had a changing red value depending on (p.x / p.y),
        where p is the pixel positions acquired using the uvN() function. I planned to change the RGB values of the color vector.
        I added a float called "b" for changing the blue value, and added a step function to divide the screen into two
        different halves. I then added a "g" variable to change the green value using a tan() function. Then I changed the
        step function to split the screen in a diagonal to add a bit more complexity, and then changed (p.x/p.y) to a (p.x * p.y)
        so the screen became a gradient of two alternating color pairs. Afterwards I created a for loop to add more functions
        to the variables created earlier. I added a vec2 to the variable "p", and then applied a tan() function to the time variable
        to add variability to the speed of movement. I then found a way to make the screen look noisy by increasing the frequency
        variable, and then I divided the screen into three parts by subtracting another step function from variable "b", and then
        found a way to get some interesting shapes by reducing the number of times the for loop runs for, and fixing the variable
        "b" to a static value. Overall I had fun adding more functions and having an idea of how it will look, then seeing what
        actually happens.

        From my peer review I got compliments for the way I did my color variable and that it was a good idea to separate
        the RGB colors. He also said he liked the way I used step to divide the canvas into separate parts. He also said
        that I had good transition between different ideas. He criticized some of the failures I had trying to implement
        certain functions like pow() and exp(), but overall he mathced the ideas I was trying to convey with what I was doing.
